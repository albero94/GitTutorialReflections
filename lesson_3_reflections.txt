When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are planning to work in different computers, group project, to avoid losing your project if you have hardware problems, to share it with people...

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Yes because you might be working on a version locally that has not been pushed yet so you don't want to pull and roll back your changes.
    Also maybe someone push changes that you still don't want to see based on your version of the program.

    - Fork is a clone but done from a github repo to a new github repo. Exclusive name for this situation. In part used to give credit to the original repo and haven them linked.
    - Branch means create a new path in the commit history to have different versions gettint updated simultaneously.
